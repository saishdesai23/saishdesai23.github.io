# About me
I am a Data Enthusiast with expertise in Natural Langauge Processing. Exploring unknown datasets and tackling problems pertaining to handling data keeps me motivated. The focus in all my projects is to make data interpretable to machine learning models through data wrangling techniques and exploratory data analysis. I like reading research papers as it keeps me updated with the State-Of-The-Art work within the NLP community.

## My Rsearch
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key element of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in information extraction. NER helps discover valuable insights from textual documents - detecting entities mentioned in unstructured text and categorizing them into predefined categories such as person, organization, location, date, etc. In the past few years, the developers have developed some NER tools for detecting such entities. The role of research funders in science is important. In order to better understand NER tools' accuracy in identifying sponsors in the research funding domain, further research is needed to analyze research funding acknowledgement statements. This project explores how well existing NER tools recognize funding organizations. Specifically, the most common existing NER tools will be evaluated for their performance to identify scenarios that need improvement, which will enable new research in the project.
