# About me
I am a Data Enthusiast with expertise in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. Exploring unknown datasets and tackling problems pertaining to handling data keeps me motivated. The focus in all my projects is to make data interpretable to machine learning models through data engineering techniques and identify patterns in data to solve business problems. I like reading research papers as it keeps me updated with the State-Of-The-Art work within the NLP community.

## My Research
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key element of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in information extraction. NER helps discover valuable insights from textual documents - detecting entities mentioned in unstructured text and categorizing them into predefined categories such as person, organization, location, date, etc. In the past few years, the developers within the NLP community have developed some NER tools for detecting entities such as the organization names. The role of research funders in science is important. In order to better understand NER tools' accuracy in identifying sponsors in the research funding domain, further research is needed to analyze research funding acknowledgement statements. This project explores how well existing NER tools recognize funding organizations. Specifically, the most common existing NER tools have been evaluated for their performance to identify scenarios that need improvement, which will enable new research pertaining to Named Entity Recogniton.
