# About me
I am a Data Enthusiast with expertise in Machine Learning, Time Series Forecasting and Natural Language Processing. I am passionate about solving real-world problems by making data interpretable to machine learning models and identifying patterns for predicting results. As an avid reader of research papers and technical articles I keep myself up-to-date with the latest advances in the field of data science. My experience in the technology consulting industry involving interaction with stakeholders from multiple indusrial sectoers makes me a skilled communicator with ability to explain complex technical concepts to non-technical audiences. I am also a team player and enjoy working collaboratively with others to achieve common goals. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.

Coding, Cooking, Consulting - The 3 Cs of my life.

# Research
- **Assessment of NER Tools for detecting Funding Organizations (Information Quality Lab, UIUC)**
  
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key element within the Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline of information extraction. NER helps discover valuable insights from textual documents by detecting entities mentioned in unstructured text and categorizing them into predefined categories such as person, organization, location, date, etc. In the past few years, the developers within the NLP community have developed some NER tools for detecting entities such as the organization names. The role of research funders in science is important. In order to better understand NER tools' accuracy in identifying sponsors in the research funding domain, further research is needed to analyze research funding acknowledgement statements. My Research explores how well existing NER tools recognize funding organizations. Specifically, the most common existing NER tools have been evaluated for their performance to identify scenarios that need improvement, which will enable new research pertaining to Named Entity Recogniton in the research funding field.

- **Review of Knowledge Powered Dialog Systems (NCSA, UIUC)**

I am co-authoring a research paper for conducting review of existing Knowledge-powered Q&A and Dialogue Systems. I have analysed 80 crowd-sourced datasets pertaining to dialogue systems and drafted a comparison of models trained on these datasets. I have also designed a generic architecture of language models responsible for knowledge selection in knowledge grounded dialogue systems.
